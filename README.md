The WindNerd anemometer is purposefully engineered for 3D printing and real-world use.
This repository includes the complete set of STL files for printing your own wind meter, along with the original **FreeCAD source file** you can edit to suit your needs.

### Features

- Easy to print in **PETG**, no supports required
- Modular and maintainable, the most exposed parts are easily replaceable
- Bearings and other [essential hardware parts](doc/BILL_OF_MATERIALS.md#small-parts) are standards
- No wiring or mechanical contacts, sensing is **fully magnetic** using Hall ICs on single integrated PCB
- Parametric design : [can be adjusted to match your mast diameter](doc/ADJUST_DIMENSIONS.md)

Electronics and essential parts are [**available as kits**](https://windnerd.net/en/shop) you can complete with your own 3D prints.
